**Introduction:**

• In this PBL we have tried to build a project using concepts producer & 
consumer in operating system. 
• We have created a ‘Producer-consumer problem’s solution’ program which 
uses arrays, pointers, semaphores (signal & wait function) for outputs.
• The complete project is performed using C language on online gbd compiler.
• This is very primitive idea which will help us to understand the theoretical 
concepts and implement them practically. 
• Producer-consumer problem is one classical example of bounder buffer 
synchronization problems. The synchronization is needed in order to ensure 
that the producer stops producing when the buffer is full and the consumer 
stops removing items from the buffer if it is empty.
• The Producer-Consumer problem is a classic problem this is used for multiprocess synchronization i.e., synchronization between more than one 
processes.

**Requirements:**

• Basic knowledge of programming & producer-consumer problem.
• In our case, sound in technical language like C/C++.
• Understanding of arrays, function creation, pointers, semaphores, mutex, and 
thread function.
• Software like VS Code or good online compiler.
